[Get Started with GoJS](https://gojs.net/latest/learn)


GoJS is rendered with an HTML5 Canvas element. Exporting to SVG and image formats are also options. GoJS can work in the web browser, or server side in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). GoJS Diagrams are backed by Models, with saving and loading typically via JSON.

GoJS is a flexible library that can be used to create a number of different kinds of interactive diagrams, including data visualizations, drawing tools, and graph editors. There are samples for [flowchart](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/flowchart.html), [org chart](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/orgChartEditor.html), [business process BPMN](https://gojs.net/latest/extensions/BPMN.html), [swimlanes](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/swimlanes.html), [timelines](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/timeline.html), [state charts](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/statechart.html), [kanban](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/kanban.html), [network](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/network.html), [mindmap](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/mindMap.html), [sankey](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/sankey.html), [family trees](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/familyTree.html) and [genogram charts](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/genogram.html), [fishbone diagrams](https://gojs.net/latest/extensions/Fishbone.html), [floor plans](https://gojs.net/latest/projects/floorplanner/FloorPlanner.html), [UML](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/umlClass.html), [decision trees](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/decisionTree.html), [pert charts](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/PERT.html), [Gantt](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/gantt.html), and [hundreds more](https://gojs.net/latest/samples/index.html).
